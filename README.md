# BattleMonsters
(work in progress)
Battle Monsters!  An open source battle-ship game with a twist.
Different levels of AI - some are easy, some are brutal.
Different sized levels - some are small, some are huge.
Different shaped enemies - no longer just a straight line.
Different rules - enemies might move (hard setting), weapons might have different effects (more than one space).

Most of this has already been implemented in an assignment, so I have to rebuild it so I don't copyright infringe myself.
Original implementation is command-line console, but we wanted to do a GUI and have some graphics.  That's the goal, so you can play either if you want.
